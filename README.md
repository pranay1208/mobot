:x: HKU's Moodle is clunky and cluttered. Searching through it everyday for updates to course content is painstaking and time-consuming

✔️ Mobot uses web-scraping to retrieve your courses' information (in under 30 seconds) and shows you updates to their content, as well as helps in better visualising submissions and deadlines

⏰ Mobot allows you to add up to 6 courses, and set multiple reminders for submissions, letting you stay up-to-date with all upcoming assignments.
